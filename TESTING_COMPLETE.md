python run_tests.py performance  # Load and performance tests
python run_tests.py api          # API endpoint tests only
python run_tests.py ai           # AI core module tests
python run_tests.py services     # Business service tests
python run_tests.py workers      # Background worker tests
python run_tests.py all          # Complete test suite
python run_tests.py fast         # Quick validation (no performance)
python run_tests.py smoke        # Basic functionality checks
```
